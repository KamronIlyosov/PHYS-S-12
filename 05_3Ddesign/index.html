<h3>Week 5: 3D Design & Printing</h3>

<h4> I decided to design and 3D print a prototype part of my final project, and assembled it with a DC motor, gearbox, a metal rod, and a breadboard. I also added LED lights that glow when power is produced, to help demonstrate how my final project will work.</h4>

<h3><strong> Step By Step Process: </strong></h3>
<br>
<h4> For the first step, I designed the main component of my final project, which would be the part that straps onto your outer thigh.</h4>

<br>
<br>
<h4> For the second step, I imported my design into PrusaSlicer, but had a slight issue: my component was too large to 3D print, so I scaled it down to 56%. Luckily this didnt affect the final product since it was just a prototype, for the next step I exported it into an SD card. This allowed me to simply put the SD card into the 3D printer and start the print.</h4>

<h4>Next, I mounted a DC motor and gearbox to my 3D printed part seamlessly and had to figure out how to secure a rod onto the motor shaft, which would be mounted onto your calf in the final project. To do this I drilled out a hole with the same diameter as the motor shaft, and threaded out the rod so I could screw on an M6 bolt to grip onto the motor shaft going through the hole I drilled out.</h4>

<br>
<br>
<h4>Once my prototype was assembled, I decided to laser cut a platform with a hole that matches the motors diameter in order to mount the prototype on and make it look more put together. I also used a adhesive tape to attach a breadboard beside the prototype which is where I connected the LED lights.</h4>

<h2> Assignment Part 2:<h2>
  <br>
<h4>After finishing my final project prototype, I scanned my favorite shoes using a photogrammetry application on Iphone called "Polycam", I chose the object scan option and scanned my object with two full rotations. This allowed me to process the scan within the app and download my 3D scan, however it required me to pay to download as STL or OBJ, so I downloaded the video version of my scan. </h4>
