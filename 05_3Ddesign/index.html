<h3>Week 5: 3D Design & Printing</h3>

<h4> I decided to design and 3D print a prototype part of my final project, and assembled it with a DC motor, gearbox, a metal rod, and a breadboard. I also added LED lights that glow when power is produced, to help demonstrate how my final project will work.</h4>
<br>
<h3><strong> Step By Step Process: </strong></h3>
<br>
<h4> For the first step, I designed the main component of my final project, which would be the part that straps onto your outer thigh.</h4>

<h4> For the second step, I imported my design into PrusaSlicer, but had a slight issue: my component was too large to 3D print, so I scaled it down to 56%. Luckily this didnt affect the final product since it was just a prototype, for the next step I exported it into an SD card. This allowed me to simply put the SD card into the 3D printer and start the print.</h4>

<h4>Next, I mounted a DC motor and gearbox to my 3D printed part seamlessly and had to figure out how to secure a rod onto the motor shaft, which would be mounted onto your calf in the final project. To do this I drilled out a hole with the same diameter as the motor shaft, and threaded out the rod so I could screw on an M6 bolt to grip onto the motor shaft going through the hole I drilled out.</h4>
