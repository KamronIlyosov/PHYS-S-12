<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Mini Drone</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

This mini drone will involve designing a lightweight quadcopter and a radio transmitter, fabricated using 3d printers, laser cut and CNC cut parts. It will be powered with a LiPo battery and feature basic stabilization and may include add ons such as a small camera and LED lights. The main goal is to create a compact drone capable of taking flight. This project will demonstrate skills in electronics, digital fabrication and coding.

<h4>Idea 2: Charging Device Powered By walking</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

This charging device will be powered by simply walking, it will be strapped to your leg with a comfortable brace and as you bend your knee while walking, it will turn a pulley system which spins a DC motor, generating electricity. This electricity will go through a voltage regulator and is then stored in any small battery or a small device of your choice! The goal of this project its to make eco-friendly electricity using daily movements such as walking.

<h4>Idea 3: Walking Device For The Blind</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

This project will be a compact head strap with integrated sensors and speakers, which will warn the blind when they are in the proximity of an obstacle, allowing them to walk safely and confidently. This will be fabricated using a 3D printer and cut parts, along with a comforable strap for daily use. The goal of this project is to help the blind and let them walk safely and avoid obstacles.
